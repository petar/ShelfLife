		<h2>Integration</h2>
		<p>Integrating Sociability in your exisiting web infrastructure takes two steps.
		Since Sociability has its own API server for AJAX calls which also sets cookies,
		first you need to configure your server infrastructure to re-direct API requests to the
		Sociability server. Second, you will have to add a few lines to your existing
		web pages in order to enable the various features.
		</p>
		<h3>Configuring your server</h3>

		<p>The Sociability server serves HTTP API calls under the URL <code>/api/</code> and
		some static resources (like style sheets and UI templates) under the URL
		<code>/s/</code>. The client-side JavaScript of Sociability (the script
		<code>/s/js/ss.js</code>) makes various AJAX calls to the API in order to
		perform its duties.
		</p>

		<p>Let's say that your web pages are served under the hostname
		<code>dpla.gov</code>. For security considerations, browsers don't allow
		AJAX calls going to domains other than the domain where the web page came from
		(in this case <code>dpla.gov</code>). This is why, even though the Sociability
		server may run on a separate machine, your web server (perhaps something like Apache) 
		or your front HTTP reverse proxy (perhaps something like NGINX) should be configured
		to forward all requests to URLS of the form <code>dpla.gov/api/...</code> and
		<code>dpla.gov/s/...</code> to the host that runs the Sociability server.
		Exactly how this is done depends on what software you are using.
		</p>
