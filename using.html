		<h2>User guide</h2>
		<p>The User Guide discusses how to insert pre-made sociability UX components inside
		your web pages.
		</p>
		<h3>Like button</h3>

		<p>Before we can look at the Like button we need to discuss social objects.
		The like system is designed on the premises that users can "like" objects. These
		objects are treated as abstract entities, identified by a unique and unchanging
		string identifier. The reason for this design choice is so to enable the like system
		to co-exist with objects that might not be a part of Sociability itself, rather a
		part of your pre-existing site logic. Because these objects are "external" to
		Sociability, they are called <em>foreign objects</em> and their respective
		identifiers are called <em>foreign IDs</em>.
		As an example, consider a library web site where a book is a natural object (that is
		not known to Sociability per se). You (the developer) can choose some permanent
		book identifier, like the ISBN number, as the foreign ID for each book.</p>

		<p>Once you make up your mind on the structure of your foreign IDs, inserting a like
		button is quite simple. All you have to do is add the following HTML markup at the
		location in the page where you want to the like button to appear:</p>

		<pre><div class="inject-like" fid="isbn:123456789-0"></div></pre>
