RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTERNAL PROJECTS
===================================

This file documents what external projects are being used in ShelfLife.

It is imperative that the release (ideally all) versions of the project
document which versions of the included projects are used in a working
version of this project, so that the binaries can always be reproduced.

Eventually, we'll actually fetch our own copies of all included projects
into this directory (and update them as necessary).

The Go Language version MUST also be documented below.
